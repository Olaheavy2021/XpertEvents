# Event Management System

This is an event management system built with PHP, HTML, and CSS. The system is designed with modularity, cohesion, coupling, and abstraction principles in mind, all of which are core concepts in Object Oriented Programming.

## Object-Oriented Programming Principles

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on the use of objects to represent data and the operations that can be performed on that data. The following principles are essential in OOP and have been applied to this project:

### Modularity

Modularity refers to the ability to break a program down into smaller, more manageable pieces, or modules. Each module should be self-contained and should only interact with other modules through a well-defined interface. In this project, the system has been designed with several modules that can be easily modified, replaced, or extended without affecting other parts of the system.

### Cohesion

Cohesion refers to the degree to which the elements within a module belong together. High cohesion means that the elements within a module are closely related and work together to achieve a single, well-defined purpose. In this project, each module has been designed to have high cohesion, ensuring that the code is organized and easy to understand.

### Coupling

Coupling refers to the degree to which one module depends on another. Low coupling means that each module is relatively independent and can be modified or replaced without affecting other modules. In this project, the modules have been designed with low coupling, allowing for easy maintenance and modification.

### Abstraction

Abstraction refers to the ability to hide implementation details and only expose essential features to the user. In this project, the system has been designed with abstraction in mind, ensuring that the user only interacts with the essential features of the system, and implementation details are hidden.
